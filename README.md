## Introduction
Welcome to the **Mastermind** game setup guide! Follow the steps below to set up and run the application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9.13** minimum installed.
- Tkinter installed: Tkinter is included with Python by default for Python versions 3.9.13 and later. If it's not already installed, you can install it separately depending on your operating system.
- If you don't have this installed yet go to [[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3128/)]to get the instructions to download python.
- **Git** installed.

## Steps to Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:whuang1101/Mastermind.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Repository
```bash
cd Mastermind
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

#### If You Don‚Äôt Have `virtualenv` Installed:
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

#### Create and Activate the Virtual Environment:
- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On **Linux/Mac**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Applications

#### Start the Backend Server
```bash
python backend.py
```

#### Start the Frontend Application
- Open a new terminal to run the Front end.
```bash
python main.py
```

## Notes
- Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.
- Make sure all dependencies are installed properly to avoid runtime errors.

Enjoy playing **Mastermind**!

  **All Player History**
  - Implement all player histories instead of just current player
  **Leaderboard**
  - Query-based on different things like difficulty

## Parting Thoughts:
Building Mastermind has been an incredibly rewarding experience, particularly in enhancing my backend engineering skills. Implementing features such as user accounts, game state management, and saving/loading game progress provided valuable insights into server-side logic and data persistence, as well as the integration between frontend and backend. Looking back, I recognize areas where earlier testing and a more structured approach to database operations could have streamlined the process. My enthusiasm for Flask and relational databases continues to grow, and I‚Äôm eager to explore best practices as I continue refining the game.

With plenty of room for further development, especially around player history tracking and leaderboards, I'm excited to keep evolving the project and further hone my backend skills. The journey has reinforced my passion for learning and continuous improvement!
